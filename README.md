## Introduction

remotia is an open source framework for building remote rendering software, implemented in pure Rust.

The objective of this project is to provide:

- A easy to customize benchmarking tool to researchers that want to evaluate their network communication protocols and encoders in a context of real-time video streaming.

- A solid basis for teams that want to develop both the server and the client part of a remote rendering solution, with a special focus on cloud gaming and real-time desktop streaming.

## Author's note

As of the time of writing, remotia is a one-man PhD project. My aim is to fill the gap that other discontinued projects like GamingAnywhere left, providing an OS/Hardware agnostic platform to run the same kind of experiments while relying on a modern language like Rust.
Contributions, tips and reviews are appreciated and encouraged.

Lorenzo.
